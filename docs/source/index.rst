Contributing
------------
As with any coding project, there are many ways to contribue. To report a bug or suggest a feature, `open an issue on the github repository`. If you would like to contribute code, we would recommend that you first `raise an issue`_ before diving into writing code, so we can let you know if we are working on something similar already. To e.g. fix typos in documentation or in the code, or for other minor changes, feel free to make pull requests directly.
